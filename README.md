# Bioinformatics Immunology EMC Website 

## Overview

#### Why this website?
This is the website of our research group. We work in bioinformatics 
and we want to make our lab and work more public, we also aim
get in contact with other groups and  eventually stablish new collaborations.
 
 
#### UX
The Website is build as mobile-first responsive, for iPad and desktop there are some variations.
This website was designed thinking in other researcher which want to know a bit more about
our group and our work and get in contact if they want to collaborate. In is not easy, in 
The official EMC website find information of an small group, EMC web is also not aesthetic 
to keep the interested of new collaborators.

I didn't use any computer wireframes or mockups, I did use paper wireframes, I made a picture 
of them to include them here.


#### Features
##### Existing Features
Home page with few lines about the group with lÂ¡nks to other pages
Contact form is working but it is not fully functional because, there no real alert to 
anyone in the team when someone fill the form and there is no database to record it.



##### Features Left to Implement
The contact will be fully functional and we will create a database to keep record of the
possible collaborators.
When we collaborate in more project we will include then in the work and project sections.

#### Testing 
 
All pages were tested locally and on GitHub using Chrome, Firefox or Safari developer 
tools. The test was mainly checking the responsiveness of all pages in different sizes, 
mainly iPhone5, iPad and desktop. All links were tested along with the youtube videos.
The form in the contact page were tested as follows:
 
-Go to Let's collaborate 
-Try to submit the from empty or incomplete or wrong information 


We had a problem with the footer in Chrome browser, a gap in the right side of the footer
apear for no reason aparently, but it was only when we check the page in the Chrome browser
nothing happen in Safari or Firefox.   




#### Deployment

Website was code using pyCharm, local Git was used for version control and then 
uploaded to GitHub using MacOX, well the Terminal window in pyCharm. Once in GitHub
it was made live using GitHub pages. The Website can be found at:
