[Bioinformatics Immunology Lab](https://lgleon.github.io/MilestoneOne/) TThis is the website of our 
research group. We work in bioinformatics and we want to make our lab and work more public, we also 
aim get in contact with other groups and  eventually stablish new collaborations.

## UX

### Why this website

The Website is build as mobile-first responsive, for iPad and desktop there are some variations.
This website was designed thinking in other researcher which want to know a bit more about
our group and our work and get in contact if they want to collaborate. In is not easy, in 
The official EMC website find information of an small group, EMC web is also not aesthetic 
to keep the interested of new collaborators.


### Wireframes
- There are no computer, mobile or any digital wireframes or mockups. 
- There is a paper wireframe, picture included in the folder  (assets/images/MilestoneOne_wireframe.jpeg)
 
 

## Features

### Existing Features

- The Contact form is working but it is not fully functional because, there is no real alert to 
anyone within the team when someone submits the form.



### Features Left to Implement

- The contact will be fully functional, and we will create a database to keep record of the
possible collaborators.
- When we collaborate in more projects we will include them in the work and 
project sections.

This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and various different technologies to work as 
helpers to the languages.
- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
    - **HTML5** HyperText Markup Language.

    - **PyCharm** Is the IDE used to develop the website.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
    - **Github** is used: 
    1. As a remote backup of code used in the project.
    2. As a remote server for another user to see the code used in the project.
    3. For users to view the deployed version of the website. The deployed version can be viewed [here!](https://lgleon.github.io/genomic_data/).

- [Bootstrap](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/)
    - **Bootstrap** is used to create easier & cleaner responsiveness in addition with helping maintain padding and margins.
    - It's also used to include modal features to the website to give it a professional look.
    
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - **JQuery** has been used to simplify DOM manipulation.



## Testing 
 
- All pages were tested locally and on GitHub using Chrome, Firefox or Safari developer 
tools. 
- The tests were mainly checking the responsiveness of all pages in different sizes, 
using iPhone5/6/7/8/X, Galaxy android phones, iPad 1/2/3/Pro and desktop. 
- All links were tested along with the YouTube videos. 
- The contact form was tested trying to submit the form empty or incomplete to be sure that all 
requirements fields must be filled before submitting.  


## Deployment

The project was built using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), through a built-in function called 'Git', I could commit
the project & push it up to [GitHub](https://github.com/).

- To view the deployed version of [Immunology Bioinformatics Lab](https://lgleon.github.io/MilestoneOne/) I needed to take the following steps:
    - Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
    - Select **lgleon/genomic_data** from the list of repositories.
    - Select **Settings** from the navbar near the top of the page.
    - Scroll down to where it says **Github Pages**, there is a subtitle labelled **Source**, click that and change the source to be **master branch**.
    - The page is automatically refreshed and ready for deployment, it can take up to 5-10 minutes for it to be viewable.

- To add this repository to your local workspace:
    - Click on the [Genomic Data repository on GitHub!](https://lgleon.github.io/genomic_data) link.
    - Select the green button on the right-hand side named **Clone or download** and copy the clone URL.
    - Go into your local workspace and open up a new terminal (git bash).
    - You will need to be inside of the directory that you want to add the cloning to.
    - Type `git clone ` and paste the URL you copied from GitHub and press enter. It should look like this: 
```console
git clone https://github.com/*username*/*repository*
```
The process of cloning will now be completed. For further information on cloning,
 visit [How to clone from GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository).



## Credits

### Content
- All Content has been thought of and written by the Developer. 
- The content of the project is original from the Immunology Department at EMC.

### Media
- The main background photo for the home page was created as a logo for my own web from a designer friend, 
we created it together design and brainstorm process. 
- The figures for the projects were generated  during the analysis of the data and they are originals.
